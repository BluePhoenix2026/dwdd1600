        <h1>Ancient Roman Empire</h1>
        <h2>What was the Ancient Roman Empire?</h2>
        <p>Ancient Rome began as an Italic settlement, traditionally dated to 753 BC, beside the <em>River Tiber</em> in
            the Italian peninsula. The settlement grew into the city and polity of Rome, and came to control its
            neighbours through a combination of treaties and military strength. It eventually controlled the Italian
            Peninsula, assimilating the Greek culture of southern Italy (Magna Graecia) and the Etruscan culture, and
            then became the dominant power in the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. At its height it controlled
            the North African coast, Egypt, Southern Europe, and most of Western Europe, the Balkans, Crimea, and much
            of the Middle East, including Anatolia, the Levant, and parts of Mesopotamia and Arabia. That empire was
            among the largest empires in the ancient world, covering around 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million
            square miles) in AD 117, with an estimated <strong>50 to 90 million inhabitants</strong>, roughly 20% of the
            world's population at the time. The Roman state evolved from an elective monarchy to a classical republic
            and then to an increasingly autocratic military dictatorship during the Empire.</p>
        <p>Ancient Rome is often grouped into classical antiquity together with ancient Greece, and their similar
            cultures and societies are known as the Greco-Roman world. Ancient Roman civilisation has contributed to
            modern language, religion, society, technology, law, politics, government, warfare, art, literature,
            architecture, and engineering. Rome professionalised and expanded its military and created a system of
            government called res publica, the inspiration for modern republics such as the United States and France. It
            achieved impressive technological and architectural feats, such as the empire-wide construction of aqueducts
            and roads, as well as more grandiose monuments and facilities.</p>
