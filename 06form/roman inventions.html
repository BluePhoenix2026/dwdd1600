        <h1>What did the Romans Invent?</h1>
        <h2>Famous Inventions</h2>
        <p>The romans could be considered the pioneers of creation, making inventions that we still use today such as:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Concrete</dt>
            <dd>
                Roman concrete, made from volcanic ash, lime, and seawater, was incredibly durable. This material
                allowed for the construction of enduring structures like the Pantheon and the Colosseum, and its use has
                influenced modern building techniques.
            </dd>
            <br>
            <dt>The Aqueduct</dt>
            <dd>
                Roman aqueducts were sophisticated systems of channels and bridges designed to transport water from
                distant sources into cities. This innovation provided a reliable water supply, which was crucial for
                urban development and public health.
            </dd>
            <br>
            <dt>The Postal Service</dt>
            <dd>
                The Cursus Publicus, or public way, was the government-run messenger and transport system of the Roman
                Empire, which was a forerunner of today's postal service.
            </dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Public Sanitation</dt>
            <dd>
                One of the most often ignored but essential achievements of the Romans was their early method of public
                sanitation. The Romans knew the value of keeping clean for public health, and they built a large and
                very modern
                sanitation system, which had underground pipes, street cleaning teams, and fresh water from aqueducts.
                Roman towns had public toilets called latrines. Specifically, they were social spaces and could hold up
                to 50 people at once.
            </dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Newspapers</dt>
            <dd>
                The Romans also created an early form of daily news called Acta Diurna, or 'Daily Acts'. It listed
                political and military news, official orders, trial results, births, deaths and public events.
            </dd>
            <br>
            <dt>Surgical Tools and Techniques</dt>
            <dd>
                Roman medical kits included tools like forceps, catheters, scalpels, bone drills, and simple specula.
                The Romans did not invent surgery, they learned from the Greek physician Hippocrates and Galen of
                Pergamon and made their own designs. Some tools targeted specific tasks, such as removing cataracts or
                bladder stones.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>These inventions were the building blocks for what we use today, and maybe even take for granted.</p>
